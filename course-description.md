## Description

How can we create visual content that is informative, accessible, and beautiful? In this course, we will explore how algorithmic and aesthetic principles can be employed in concert to create interactive, graphical content on the web. Topics will include design layout and combinatorial optimization, the geometry of color spaces, graph drawing, computational geometry, and visualization of data and algorithms. We will investigate these topics from both theortical and applied perspectives, and provide implementations using modern web development tools: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, we will consider issues of algorithmic efficiency in solving computationally intensive problems.
